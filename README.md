# hammerspoon-config
My configuration files for [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org "Hammerspoon").  
*  Mostly random codes here and there, some of them are copied other are actually written by me. Battery configuration is done. Cheatsheet copycat is on progress, nearly done, few things to fix here and there. Windows configurations work great too.  Others are not really finalized.
